## Prerequisites

- Java 11+
- Maven 3.6+
- Azure CLI
- **Azure Storage Account** (for file storage)
- **Azure Key Vault** (for storing secrets)
- **Azure PostgreSQL Database** (for metadata)

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stashit.git
    cd stashit
    ```

2. **Provision Azure resources**
    - Create Storage Account, Key Vault, PostgreSQL Database, and App Service with Managed Identity.
    - Store database credentials in Key Vault.

3. **Configure environment variables**
    ```
    AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=<your-storage-connection-string>
    AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URI=<your-keyvault-uri>
    SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=<your-postgresql-url>
    ```

4. **Deploy to Azure App Service**
    - Ensure Managed Identity is enabled and has access to Key Vault.

5. **Run locally**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
